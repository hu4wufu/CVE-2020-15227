CVE-2020-15227
==============

I made this exploit according to ignoracy of David Grudl (The founder of Nette foundation)
as he mostly does not give a fuck and is really not into fixing his security issues in time, giving documentation 
to security guys to inspect possible compromisation and hiding it. Ok, here we go man. 

As a security researcher I developed a little monster (for educational and demonstrational purposes of course)

The security vulnerability exploits callback parameter in nette.micro. We have no idea why the crap that exists (possible backdoor feature?)

Exploit is trying to get reverse shell from the victim server. The URL is hardcoded here so no stress about exploit edits.

PRs are welcomed!
